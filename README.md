# Arcane Ascent!

This is a passion project, initially thought up by a friend (Noah Simpson) 

It allows a player to traverse up a tower and progress their spellbook in order to defeat enemies on each floor. 
It's gameplay is rather RNG based, but the spellbooks page creation is down to the players choice, leaving room for player skill to shine as well.

## How to play

I'll... get back to you when the game works... :/
